Debian Testing and enriched with its own set of applications to help
new users and linux old-timers get set up quickly and easily to an aesthetically pleasing 'desktop'.

antiX-core is 100% Debian 'free' (according to the vrms application) and uses a modified gnu-kernel.
antiX-base and antiX-full both come with firmware and a few applications from the contrib and/or non-free
Debian repositories.
To make antiX-full and/or antiX-base Debian 'free', just follow the simple steps below.

1. Comment out the contrib and non-free references from the Debian repository.
2. Use the vrms application to show what 'non-free' packages to uninstall.
   Simply type vrms in a terminal.
3. apt-get purge firmware* should be enough to remove non-free applications.
3. apt-get purge conky-all (it should be replaced by conky-std) libxnvctrl0 flash* b43* should be enough to remove
   contrib applications.
4. apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade
5. Install the antiX gnu kernel

Should I remove the antiX apps?

Not really recommended (the apps are free), but it may be better to just remove the ones you 
don't need.
